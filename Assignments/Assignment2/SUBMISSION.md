HTML Personal Portfolio Website Assignment
Description:
The goal of this assignment is to create a profilo for future use and to slowly include future projects and information. Key tasks are enhance your portfolio by embedding a YouTube video or audio, adding iframes for a GitHub project preview, and showcasing extra-curricular activities like hobbies or volunteer work. Ensure proper file organization for better structure and performance.

Approach / What I Did:
I started off by looking at the exmaple posted and try to create a early version of the website, then I changed it into a different style by adding a style section. After I look though the different part of the project and adding it one by one. At the end I did a review of all codes and added comments and notes.

Code Explanation:
This navigation block allows users to quickly jump to different sections of the website by clicking on the links. Each <a> tag uses a fragment identifier (#section-id), which links to a specific with the corresponding id.

For example:
Clicking "About" takes the user to <section id="about">.
"Education", "Experience", "Projects", "Hometown", "Additional Information", and "Contact" work the same way.

<!----<nav>
        <a href="#about">About</a>
        <a href="#education">Education</a>
        <a href="#experience">Experience</a>
        <a href="#projects">Projects</a>
        <a href="#hometown">Hometown</a>
        <a href="#Additional Information">Additional Information </a>
        <a href="#contact">Contact</a>
